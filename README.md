A truth that cannot be denied is that traffic networks are the backbone for modern cities
and localities. All over the world, they seek to facilitate transportation from point to another;
in other words, developing countries are today establishing new airports, ports, highways, and
subways as well as their continuous work on improving the facilities they already have before planning new ones. Therefore, the scientific research done by engineers and modeled by
mathematicians is looking forward to establish a complete description of traffic flow characteristics that would help figuring out serious issues. We started our mission from a mathematical
model that basically expresses the flow of traffic using the Lighthill – Whitham–Richards Model
(LWR) and some equations branching from this model to reach the final forms that relate speed
and flow with other parameters. Furthermore, we integrated some basic principles from game
theory with the established model to show its effectiveness in studying drivers’ behaviors; then
we have formed a complete model for a common real situation using game theory. The results
produced by equations were not only proved using simulations but also by comparing with real
data from other modern sources. Finally, we have discussed some of future work that could be
introduced to the researched topic
